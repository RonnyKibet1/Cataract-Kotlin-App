A cataract surgery procedure frequently lasts not more than an hour. It is usually painless. Most of the time, individuals who undergo cataract surgery choose to be awake during the procedure, although there are some who would rather be put to sleep for a short time. On the other hand, if the patient chooses to be awake, the patient will be given an anesthetic to numb the nerves that surround the eyes. A “lid speculum” will then hold the patient’s eye. The procedure is usually not uncomfortable. In after cataract surgery the patient will be given an eye shield to be placed over the eye. In some after cataract surgery effects, the patient will experience some increase sensitivity to light and a small amount of fluid will sometimes discharge from the eye. The fluid discharge is also common in after cataract surgery. After cataract surgery the patient may experience slight discomfort but this will decrease and disappear completely within the next few days. Itching and mild discomfort is normal. Most patients usually go home right away after the surgery procedure although the patient is restricted from driving.
Immediately after surgery the doctor will schedule the patient for exams to follow up on the patient’s progress. The patient is then prescribed with some eye drops or antibiotics to help increase the healing process. Once the dressing on the eye is removed the patient is advised to wear the eye shield when sleeping to protect the eye from injuries and damages.
Here are some guidelines for the patients to follow after the cataract surgery procedure:
* Avoid strenuous exercises for two to three weeks after cataract surgery procedure.
* Avoid manual labor two weeks after cataract surgery.
* Avoid vigorous sports two weeks after undergoing cataract surgery. Swimming is safe a month after the cataract procedure.
Follow these guidelines and you will improve you vision with less complications. Although some patients still need glasses or contact lenses despite the development of their vision.

The most common after cataract surgery problems are increased pressure, inflammation, blurring of vision because of swelling, pain, redness and bleeding. The most serious (but rare) after cataract surgery problems are infection, loss of vision and light flashes. The patient should contact their doctor if they experience increasing pain and progressive worsening of vision after the cataract surgery. All these complications can be treated if given prompt medical attention.
It is important to remember not to put your fingers in your eye after the cataract operation. Do not lift heavy objects because it increases the pressure in the eye. Have a good rest. And most importantly you should take your medications exactly as the doctor has prescribed. See your doctor if you are experiencing any problems.
