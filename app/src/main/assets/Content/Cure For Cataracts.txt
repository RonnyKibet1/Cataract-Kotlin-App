A cataract is the opacity that develops in the lens of the eye. The lens is the part of the eye that is responsible for fine focusing. The lens of the eye consists of strong and transparent capsule that is filled with a clear gel like material. When the capsule becomes cloudy the light that enters through it becomes distorted or blocked, preventing it from reaching the retina, thus, reducing the vision. If you have cataracts and are having difficulties in your vision, your doctor will recommend surgery. There is no known cure for cataracts other than surgery. On the other hand, recent studies show that anti-oxidants (for example, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin E) are cure for cataracts because it causes the delay of the development of cataracts.
The conventional cure for cataracts is to remove the lens and replace it with an intraocular lens. As of now, the technology by which to perform cataract surgery has already matured and a cataract surgery procedure usually last within a few minutes. However, the plastic substitute can not focus automatically that is why some patients still have to wear eyeglasses to correct their vision.
On the other hand, researchers are trying to develop a new material that can be injected in the human eye to function like a healthy lens.  This gel like material can be flexed by the ciliary muscles of the eye, providing the needed adjustments to see near and far (a normal functioning lens of the eye thickens and flattens in order to see close and distant objects). However, experts face some problems with this kind of cure for cataract. First, they have to find out the amount to be injected in the eyes. Second, is that how can they prevent the material from leaking out of the hole that they made in order to inject the hydro gel.
There are some cases wherein the cataract is mild enough to be treated naturally with herbs, exercises and other alternative therapy.  Despite the consequences, if some individual wants to use this kind of cure for cataract, they must first consult their doctor. There some unreliable reports stated that cataracts in its early stage can be reverted with the use of some of the following guidelines:
* Limit the consumption of foods that contain lactose or milk products.
* A supplementary diet of 10-50 mg of riboflavin daily may help cure or slow down the progression of cataract formation.
* Taking 1000 mg of vitamin C twice daily may help decrease the damage caused by free radicals, thus helps cure cataracts.
* A daily dosage of 200mg to 600mg of N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) along with copper and zinc may cure cataract by destroying free radical.

Cataract can be detected while it is still on its early stage through a complete eye check up.
