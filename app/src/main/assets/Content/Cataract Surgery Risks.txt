Cataract surgery is the most common surgery procedure performed in the United States. Because of today’s advance technology and surgical techniques, it is one the most effective surgery procedures (with over ninety percent success rate). However as with any surgery, cataract surgery also has some risks. The most common cataract surgery risks are infection and bleeding.
The clouding of the back part of the capsule is also one of the cataract surgery risks. Swelling of the retina is one of the potential cataract surgery risks, although this risk tends to disappear after a few weeks. Below are some of the potential cataract surgery risks and complications:
* Astigmatism – astigmatism can develop after the cataract surgery. However this can be treated through corrective lenses and has no effect on the vision.
* Infection – although this type of cataract surgery risk is not common but still possible. That is due to negligence in sterile techniques.
* Hemorrhage – stile not common but possible, this is sometimes cause by the placement of the incision in the cornea region of the eye.
* Swelling of the Cornea – it is caused by the response of the eye from the surgical instrument that is inserted. Usually not noticed until a few hours after the surgery procedure. May cause distorted vision.
* Glaucoma – the development of glaucoma is one of the potential cataract surgery risks. This is caused by some of the fluids used during the surgery which does not pass through the eye’s natural drainage system which causes an increase in pressure inside the eyes. Often marked with sharp pain in the eye region or headache. The pressure can be lower through medication.
* Retinal Detachment – individuals who undergo cataract surgery increase their risk in developing retinal detachment. Individuals who undergo laser surgery procedure to cure the opacity of the lens covering after a cataract surgery procedure poses even greater risks in developing retinal detachment.
Some of the cataract surgery risks and complications can be treated with further surgery procedure. Some of theses complications may have some effect on your vision even with treatment.
However if you opt not to undergo cataract surgery, the cataract will slowly deteriorate your vision. Its effects can disrupt your abilities on your daily and nightly activities (the vision problems are even greater at night time).
There are many advantages if you choose to have your cataract removed. It can improve your color vision. Colors will be more vibrant and vivid. Visual acuity is greatly improved. The lens (intraocular lens) that is implanted on the cataract surgery will greatly decrease the focusing problems which lead to the reduced dependence on corrective eyewear. Although glasses may still be needed when reading or driving.
