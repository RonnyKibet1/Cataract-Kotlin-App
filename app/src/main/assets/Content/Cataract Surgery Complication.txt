Most people think that cataract is a disease. It is not. The fact is, cataract is a condition; a condition that develops in the crystalline lens of the eyes. It is the clouding or the opacity of the crystalline lens that prevents light from reaching the retina. Its symptoms are hazy and foggy vision that will progressively become worse over time. Aging, eye trauma, constant medical condition and prescription drugs are the main factors of developing cataracts.
Cataract removal through surgery procedure is the only way in treating cataracts. It is one of the most commonly performed surgery procedure in the world, with over ninety percent success rate. However, in some rare cases there can be some complication after the cataract has been surgically removed. Some develop unforeseen complications. The most common cataract surgery complications are loss of vision, fluctuating eye pressure, infection, bleeding, inflammation and double vision. The most common temporary cataract surgery complications are:
* Itchiness and stickiness of the eyes as well as blurry vision after the cataract surgery procedure.
* Redness of the white part of the eyes with a scratchy feeling on it.
* Some would experience pain in the eyes but this usually settles down within one or two weeks.
* The eyelid or eyes may ache.
The most serious of all the cataract surgery complications is that the lens behind the eye may tear during the surgery procedure. This type of cataract surgery complication causes damage to the vision. If this does happen, the cataract will be lost on the back of the eye and another surgery procedure must be done in order to remove the lost cataract.
There are two types of cataract surgery procedure. These are the phacoemulsification and the extracapsular surgery procedure. The most common cataract surgery complication in the phacoemulsification procedure is the clouding of the lens casing or lens capsule that is left in the eye which the intraocular lens is put in to. This type of cataract surgery complication is called “posterior capsular opacification”.  The capsule that is left behind will progressively become cloudy in the span of two years accordingly. This leads to a reduced vision, the same as having another cataract. On the other hand this type of cataract surgery complication can be corrected by laser treatment.
Below are the common cataract surgery complications:
Retinal detachment
This type of cataract surgery complication is a condition wherein the fluid seeps through a tear in the retina, which causes the retina to detach from the back of the eye.
Choroidal Hemorrhage
Choroidal hemorrhage is when the web of fine blood vessels (called “choroids”) which supplies blood to the retina bleeds during the surgery procedure. Usually transpires on older patients and patients who have glaucoma.
